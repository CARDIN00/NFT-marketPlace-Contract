# NFT-marketPlace-Contract
A NFT market place contract
Designed and implemented an ERC-721 token standard to create and manage NFTs.
Developed a marketplace where users can list their NFTs for sale and set a price, while the contract charges a marketplace fee (configurable by the contract owner).
Implemented a secure approval system using both approve (for single token) and approveForAll (for all tokens) functions.
Applied best practices in smart contract security, including ownership checks, input validation, and event logging for transparency and auditability.
